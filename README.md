This is my semester 6 AI group project,
I basically contributed to learning about how the parameters work about deciding the intelligence of an AI. Furthermore with my teammates I worked on  
- first - a brute force approach for solving an ARC problem. 
- second - tried to create a ML model based on the decision tree approach.
- third - tried to work on a existing deep learning model to make it more efficient and worked on adding parameters to display it's efficiency and accuracy.
